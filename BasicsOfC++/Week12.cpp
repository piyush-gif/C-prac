//Week 12: Transition to SFMLGoal : Apply C++ skills to start a graphical game with SFML.Key Concepts :
//•	SFML setup and basic window.
//•	Drawing sprites(sf::Sprite, sf::Texture).
//•	Event handling(sf::Event).
//•	Game loop with delta time.
//Exercises :
//	•	Set up SFML and create a window with sf::RenderWindow.
//	•	Load a sprite(sf::Sprite, sf::Texture) and draw it in the window.
//	•	Move a sprite with WASD keys using sf::Keyboard.
//	•	Create a game loop with sf::Clock to move a sprite smoothly(use delta time).
//	•	Port your Week 2 Tic - Tac - Toe board to SFML, drawing X / O as sprites.
//	Mini - Project: Graphical Tic - Tac - Toe
//	•	Use SFML to draw a 3x3 grid and place X / O sprites on mouse clicks.
