//Week 11: Optimization and DebuggingGoal : Learn to write efficient code and debug issues.Key Concepts :
//•	Profiling basics(e.g., measure execution time with std::chrono).
//•	Debugging with breakpoints(in Visual Studio or GDB).
//•	Code optimization(e.g., avoid unnecessary copies).
//Exercises :
//	•	Use std::chrono to measure how long a loop takes to process 1000 enemies.
//	•	Write a buggy program(e.g., out - of - bounds array access) and debug it with print statements.
//	•	Optimize a function by passing large objects by reference instead of by value.
//	•	Use a debugger to step through your Week 8 Hangman code and find an intentional bug(e.g., wrong win condition).
//	•	Refactor a previous project to reduce redundant calculations.
//	Mini - Project: Optimized Tic - Tac - Toe
//	•	Refactor your Tic - Tac - Toe to minimize function calls and optimize win checking.
//	•	Add timing to measure how long each game loop takes.
//	•	Debug a feature like AI to ensure it picks valid moves.
